# Kanban Board Project

## Overview
This is a **Kanban Board** built using **ReactJS**. It includes features like:
- Four columns: **To Do, In Progress, Peer Review, Done**
- Drag-and-drop functionality for task management
- Task cards with a title and truncated description
- Search bar for filtering tasks dynamically by title
- Floating button to add new tasks (only in the 'To Do' column)
- Task creation form with title and description

## Project Setup Instructions
### 1. Extracting Files
Since this project is large, all files are uploaded as separate **zip** folders. Follow these steps to extract and set up:
1. **Extract Each Folder:** Unzip each folder separately (e.g., `src.zip`, `public.zip`, `node_modules_part1.zip`, `node_modules_part2.zip`, etc.).
2. **Combine Node Modules:** Merge all extracted `node_modules` parts into a single `node_modules` folder.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Once all files are extracted, navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start the development server:
```sh
npm start
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.
